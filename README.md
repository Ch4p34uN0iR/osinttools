# osinttools
A collection of random OSINT scripts and files that can be used for OSINT, threatintel, and other data collection tasks. 

## aopy Directory Scripts
The scripts in the **aopy** directory are from or were inspired by [Justin Seitz's](https://twitter.com/jms_dot_py) excellent Python [Automating Osint](https://learn.automatingosint.com/) Master course. If you like the scripts and Python, go check out his site and trainings. 

## OSINT Maps XMind MindMap
This file is an amazing resource for people looking to up their documentation of OSINT-related investigations. Originally created by myself (Micah Hoffman) as a resource for my [SANS SEC487 OSINT class](https://www.sans.org/sec487), it was GREATLY augmented by [Steve Hall](https://twitter.com/shall_1) and is here for your use and for you to add content to it for others to use.

It requires the free [XMind MindMapping software](https://www.xmind.net/) and works on Linux, Windows, and macOS platforms.

## HIBP Script
This script is used in the SEC487 course to look up email addresses in the HaveIBeenPwned.com site using their API.
